# Godot Intervals (4.2 Backport)

This folder contains a set of demo scenes that were manually reimplemented with
Godot 4.2.2. The backport project depends on this branch's `graphedit2` and
`intervals` addons, which must be pulled in manually to the addons folder and
enabled.

The backport should match the functionality of the original library, but may
or may not be incorporated into the main branch because the workarounds have
a sizeable impact on the code patterns in the 4.3 version.
